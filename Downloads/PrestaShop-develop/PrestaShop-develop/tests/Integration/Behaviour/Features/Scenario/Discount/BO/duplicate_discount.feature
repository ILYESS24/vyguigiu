Feature: Duplicate discount
  PrestaShop allows BO users to duplicate discounts
  As a BO user
  I must be able to duplicate discounts

  Background:
    Given shop "shop1" with name "test_shop" exists
    Given there is a currency named "usd" with iso code "USD" and exchange rate of 0.92
    Given currency "usd" is the default one
    And language with iso code "en" is the default one
    Given group "visitor" named "Visitor" exists
    Given group "guest" named "Guest" exists

  Scenario: Duplicate a discount with code
    When I create a "cart_level" discount "discount_with_code" with following properties:
      | name[en-US]       | Promotion           |
      | active            | true                |
      | valid_from        | 2019-01-01 11:05:00 |
      | valid_to          | 2019-12-01 00:00:00 |
      | code              | PROMO_CART_2019     |
      | reduction_percent | 10.0                |
    And I duplicate the discount "discount_with_code" as "discount_with_code_copy"
    Then discount "discount_with_code_copy" should have the following properties:
      | name[en-US]       | copy of Promotion   |
      | type              | cart_level          |
      | active            | false               |
      | valid_from        | 2019-01-01 11:05:00 |
      | valid_to          | 2019-12-01 00:00:00 |
      | reduction_percent | 10.0                |
    And discount "discount_with_code_copy" shouldn't have "PROMO_CART_2019" as code

      | name    | zone1 |

      | grade            | 1                                  |
